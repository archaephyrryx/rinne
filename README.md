# Rinne

This is an experimental repository for an attempt at making an idle game themed around collecting grains of sand for an eternity-of-eternities-of-eternities-of-eternities...

It is based on a very narrow understanding of certain concepts and precepts originating in Buddhism, and the numeric progression is inspired directly by an obscure set of hyper-astronomical numerals from a historical treatise on Buddhist numerology. You can find more concrete details (sketchy and untranslated as they are) at my blog-post [here](https://mukankei-nashi.blogspot.com/2024/11/its-all-about-or-archive-of-sino.html).

There isn't even a concrete notion of whether this is a viable game, and how to get to the end-goal of the largest of these astronomical numerals, 不可説不可説転 (ふかせつふかせつてん) '*fu-ka-setsu-fu-ka-setsu-ten*', which is defined as $$10^{7\times2^{122}} = 10^{37218383881977644441306597687849648128}$$

Though still very much a conceptual outline, my current strategy for getting even close to progressing along the square-rule tens-powers track is to incorporate both time-dilation to speed up the progression ticks/s rate, with milestone unlocks that eventually allow the player to skip effective [mahakalpas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_(time)) to get around the fact that these numbers are unbelievably large.

I don't know whether it is even tenable to represent static values of this astronomical scale in the first place, let alone do math with them, but trying it out seems like as good a use of my free time as any.
